      New College Poker Society is a student-run society at New College, University of Oxford. We started small and now have around 70 members.
    </p>
    <p>
      We run regular low-stakes cash games and teach beginners how to play poker, covering everything from the basics to the theory and strategy behind the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to make poker accessible and social, building a community around a game we love.
